This repository contains an iPython notebook used for analysis of French presidential elections 2017.

In the first part of the notebook I esimate the vote transfers from eliminated candidates to the two running in the second round. More details on the method at https://grishaoryol.wordpress.com/2017/05/17/vote-transfers-in-french-election/
and in the notebook.

In the second part I study how scores of various candidates depend on the turnout. Read a bit more about it in [this blog post](https://grishaoryol.wordpress.com/2017/05/24/french-presidential-elections-2-the-turnout/)

The data files used are the results of the two rounds of the election for each polling station: [first](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/election-presidentielle-2017-resultats-par-bureaux-de-vote-tour-1/?disjunctive.libelle_de_la_commune)
and [second](https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/election-presidentielle-2017-resultats-par-bureaux-de-vote-tour-2/?disjunctive.libelle_de_la_commune)
